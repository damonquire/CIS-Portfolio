Damon Quire's Professional Portfolio:

This repository is a collection of a large portion of the work I have completed that relates to my major of Computer Information Systems at the University of Louisville.

I have my bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems with a track in Web Development from the University of Louisville. I am currently employed at Brick Bridge Consulting, a small startup company in Louisville, Kentucky where I am a .NET Developer. I spend most of my time working on the back end and deploying the projects to AWS or Azure so that our clients can utilize our solutions. This involves me communicating with our clients or the companies whose technology we are integrating with to ensure that our solutions are meeting expectations. 

Prior to my current job I served as a form of manager at a small archery retail shop where I would run the shop on my own and was responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and inventory. I was able to bring my technical experience to help run the shop more efficiently than it had been ran in the past. Here, I managed sales, mechanical work, inventories, and anything else the shop could throw at me. I was responsible for the entire shop on multiple occasions for weeks at a time.

In my portfolio you will find 8 different folders.
